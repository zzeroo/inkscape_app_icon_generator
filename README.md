# App Icon Generator Extension

This extension allows you to export icons created in inkscape to all the 
necessary sizes for iOS, Android and Windows applications.

This extension still has a lot of room for improvement. If you want to help out, 
feel free to check out the project on Github: 
<https://github.com/ScreamingTaco/inkscape_app_icon_generator>

Feature requests, pull requests, issues, and any other contribution welcome.

# Installation

According to the [inkscape's extension documentation] download and unpack the 
archive file. Copy the files into the directory listed at 
`Edit > Preferences > System`: **User extensions**. 
After a restart of Inkscape, the new extension will be available.
